# AprilSoft-Java4-Snake
This is a simple snake game. 

It is divided into three lessons:
1) In the first lesson, we create the head of the snake and set its movement. 
2) In the second lesson, we create an apple object and define a collision. 
3) In the third lesson, we create the body of a snake and add the possibility of winning and losing.
